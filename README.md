About:
I make this in 2. Semester when a fellow Student say i can't make a recursion Sudoku and two days after semester vacations starts i finished.
Of course it wasn't much work for me and I search for the principals of this algorithm after i failed while doing it on my own (And of Course its bad Coding)
But I'm happy with the result. And you can play it two
